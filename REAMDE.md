**Summary**

This repository contains test scripts for functional testing for Booking Form Single Page Application (BFSPA). These scripts are using Nightwatch which is a cross browser wrapper based on Selenium. Its main advantage is to be able to run parallel testing (i.e. on chrome and firefox at the same time).

## Installation

1. Install NPM and Node.
2. Clone the repository on your local machine.
3. Download "selenium-server-standalone" and set the path in "nightwatch.conf.js/server_path".
4. Install nightwatch "npm install nightwatch -g"
5. Run "npm i"
6. Run "nighwatch" if you want to launch all tests on chrome
7. Run "nightwatch tests/<folder>/<test.js> --retries -e chrome,firefox,safari" if you want to run 1 test simultaneously on 3 browsers with a retry if a test fails.
